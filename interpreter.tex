\section{Program Evaluation}

The first major design decision we must make is what kinds of programming languages we will consider. Throughout this project, we will only consider simply typed functional languages without any advanced features (such as pattern matching, exceptions, type constructors, etc...). This is because their simplicity makes them much easier to define, implement, analyze, and because they share a common grammar, which allows us to enumerate programs much more easily. What this means is that a language's behaviour should defined solely by the builtin primitive constants it provides. As we will see later on, this limitation will actually turn out to be a powerful tool in defining our search space more precisely.

\subsection{Functional Terms}

We define expressions in such a language as follows:\footnote{ The implementation we use is essentially the graph reduction technique described in \textit{The Implementation of Functional Programming Lanugages}~\cite{SLPJ}. This allows for laziness and shared reduction and is performant enough for our purposes, but more sophisticated (even optimal) algorithms exist. } 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=rust]
pub type Thunk = Rc<RefCell<Term>>; // A pointer to a mutable term
pub type Value = Rc<dyn TermValue>; // A pointer to a value

pub enum Term {
    Val(Value), // A primitive value
    Var(Identifier), // A variable identifier
    Lam(Identifier, Rc<Term>), // A lambda abstraction 
    App(Thunk, Thunk), // An application of one term on another
    Ref(Thunk), // Transparent indirection to another term 
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{Value} type stores a pointer to a value, whose type has been erased (similar to how Haskell erases all type information at runtime). The \texttt{Ref} variant is simply a transparent pointer to another term, which will be useful during term reduction. As an example, the term $(\lambda x.\mathrm{max}(x)(1))$ would be represented as follows (omitting pointers and \texttt{Ref}s, and representing application by @):

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node {$\lambda x$}
      [level distance=0.75cm]
      child {
        node {@}
        child {
          node {@}
          child {node {max}}
          child {node {$x$}}
        }
        child {node {1}}
      };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In order to simplify this syntax in our code, define a \texttt{term!} macro which parses these terms at compile-time. It allows us to write in a more familiar Haskell-style syntax, and insert variables and constants into terms:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=rust]
// A pure lambda-term
let apply = term!(f x -> f x x);

// Inserting a term stored in a variable into a template.
let square = term!([apply] multiply); 

// Literals are parsed as values  
let two = term!((a b -> a) 2 "x");

// Brackets starting with a colon indicate a variables
// should be parsed as a value.
let two = 2;
let four = term!([square] [:two]);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Functional Languages}

As stated earlier, in their most basic form, our languages are determined by the primitives they offer, each of which will be annotated with a \texttt{Type}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=rust]
pub enum Type {
    Var(Identifier),
    Fun(Rc<Type>, Rc<Type>),
}
\end{lstlisting}

In order to evaluate a term, we will have to define an environment in which to run in. We do this by defining a \texttt{Language} trait (an interface, in other languages) with a method to construct the \texttt{Context} terms will be evaluated in. We also provide a \texttt{Builtin} type and a \texttt{builtin!} macro to simplify the definition of primitives, both of whose definitions we omit from this report. A simple example we will revisit several times is the language of polynomials with positive integer coefficients:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=rust]
// Polynomials is a data structure with no fields
pub struct Polynomials;

impl Language for Polynomials {
  fn context(&self) -> Context {
    let plus = builtin!(
        N => N => N 
        |x, y| => Term::val(x.get::<i32>() + y.get::<i32>())
    );

    let mult = builtin!(
        N => N => N
        |x, y| => Term::val(x.get::<i32>() * y.get::<i32>())
    );

    // Constants, which don't take any arguments
    let one = builtin!(
        N
        | | => Term::val(1i32)
    );

    let zero = builtin!(
        N
        | | => Term::val(0i32)
    );

    //Mapping from Identifiers to builtins
    Context::new(&[
      ("plus", plus),
      ("mult", mult),
      ("one",  one ),
      ("zero", zero),
    ])
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{Term::val} function converts its argument into a \texttt{Term} by converting it into a \texttt{Value}. The \texttt{Term::get} method casts a \texttt{Term::Val} into a given type (which can never fail if our program is well-typed). It's worth noting that these primitives are strict in all their arguments. We can get around this by reducing to a projection term instead of taking extra arguments:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=rust]
// ifpos c t e = if (c) { t } { e }
// Lazy in `t' and `e' 
let ifpos = builtin!(
  Bool => N => N 
  |c| => if c.get::<bool>() {
    term!(t e -> t)
  } else {
    term!(t e -> e)
  }
)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Term Reduction}

Our reduction strategy is as follows:
